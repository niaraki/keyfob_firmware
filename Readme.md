### Development Guidlines 
#### Prerequisites
#### How To Compile 
#### Commit Message Conventions
<ol>
<li>
The first line of the commit message should be like the below format:<br/>
    <b>[type-icon] [type-name]: [scope*]: [message title] </b><br/> 
Type Table:

| icon | name | description |
|------|----|-------------|
|üì¶ | NEW | we use this type when we have added something |
|üëå | ENH | we use this type when we have modified or enhance something |
|üêõ | FIX | we use this type when we have fixed a bug |
|üé≠ | MRG | we use this type when we want to merge two branches|


<ul>
    <li>
    Scope can be a filename, a module name (*it is and optional field)
    </li>
    <li>
    Use simple present tense for the title - for example <b>add</b> instead of <b>added</b>
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
After the first line, we have the commit body which explains more about the commit
</li>
<li>
An optional footer part comes after the body and it should be like this:<br/>
resolved #[The specific <b> issue number </b> which is targeted by this commit]
</li>
<li>
Don't use fast-forward merging, because merge commits can show the history of changes better<br/>
You can disable it on your machine by using the following command:<br/>
<b>git config --global merge.ff no</b>
</li>
</ol><br/>
